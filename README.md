## Exercise 1
Create a webpage that allows the user to enter a password two times in order to validate it.
Web page content:
- Two password fields
o first to enter the password and a second to verify it
- A button labelled "Validate" that alerts one of the following messages:
- Display informative error message if any of the following occur:
▪ the passwords entered don't match
▪ the passwords are not at least 8 characters long


## Exercise 2
Create a new webpage that has a single img tag and two buttons labeled previous and next. Your slideshow
should.
- contain at least five pictures of your choice (appropriate for class)
- cycle through all the pictures
- wrap around to the beginning if I keep pushing next
- wrap around to the end if I keep pushing previous
- force the images to be all the same size regardless of the original image files' dimensions

## Exercise 3
Make a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this. You can make a profile about anybody or
anything. You are not required to make this about yourself or post any personal information online. This
profile can be entirely fictional.
HTML Requirements:
- Profile picture
- Biographical paragraph
- Hyperlinks to favorite web sites
- Embeded youtube video
CSS Requirements:
- Use all the attributes listed in the CSS section at least once.
- The page should not induce seizures or headaches - in other words, mind the color pallet you choose
- All text should be easy to read

## Exercise 4
Create a web page that have a paragraph with some dummy text. Near the paragraph have text fields to accept
the following values:
Border:
- red value
- green value
- blue value
- width
Background color:
- red value
- green value
- blue value
- width
Finally, have a button that, when clicked, changes the border and background color to be as specified. You can
use either the rgb() method or a color code, but you should tell the user what units they are in (00-FF or 0-255).

## Exercise 5
When you go to your people.eecs page, you'll most likely see a simple file listing. This is the default behavior
of apache. To make a landing page, you can write an index.html file.
In your index.html
- Use links, JS, or whatever means you like to create a menu to all your other exercises
- Spruce it up with styling so it's more than just four hyper links - apache could have given us that
without any effort
