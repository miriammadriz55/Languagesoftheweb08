      <p> I am a hispanic immigrant from mexico. This is a picture of my family and I in disney world in '06. It is incredible to have the freedom to study whatever I choose. As a latina women it is important for me to break down sterotypes and break down barriers for those before me.  </p>

        <p> A fun fact about me is I started caddying when I was fourteen. This is a picture from the 2020 BMW championship. As a caddie I not only carry a golfer's bag during a round but I ensure the pace of the round is on track and I provide tips and assistance throughout the game. I was ranked the 6th/400 caddies in 2017 at Beverly Country Club in Chicago where Barack Obama is a member.  </p>

        <p> I received The Chick Evans scholarship for caddies in 2018. It is a full ride scholarship to college. This scholarship was a reward for all the 5am mornings and 10pm nights of being at the golf course all day and night in 100 degree weather. This scholarship is awarded for caddying and academic excellence.  </p>

        <p> This is a picture of some of my closest friends at KU that I made through The Chick Evans scholarship. When having the scholarship one must live in the KU EVANS chapter house during the four year program. It has been an incredible experience to be a part of something so amazing and I cannot wait to see what the future holds.  </p>

        <p>  A little bit about me, my name is Miriam Madriz, I am a future '22 KU graduate. In my free time I enjoy going to concerts. This is a picture of me at a Lollapolooza concert in my hometown of Downtown Chicago. I hope to be attending Bad bunny's concert in March 2022. </p>
